* __Site Owner Goals__:

  * Creating an effective website.

  * Gather information on what type of beauty services people are looking for.
  * Recieve contact details through use of contact form.




# User Requirements and Expectations

  * __Requirements__:


   * Navigate the website using the navbar which should be clear and hierarchical.
  
   * Be provided with information of different services of the salon.

   * Contact Form validation to help against spam.







  * __Expectations__:

  * Content is visually satisfying and informative.
  
  * Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website.

  * Form Validation works correctly.


# Design Choices

* __Fonts__:
  
  I will use the font [LATO](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) as it  a very simple style which provides the easiest
   nature of the overall site design.
   
    The focus of the content is to provide an informative experience for the customer,
     so i think this is the right font for my project.

* __Icons__:
  
  The icons used are self explanatory , so easy for users to interpret what the icon will actually do. 
  I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons.
 I had to make sure that the icon was perfect size on smaller devices to ensure easy access.

* __Colours__:
  
   Purple colour is a delicate color that means sweet, nice, 
   playful, cute, romantic, charming, and tenderness,
    is associated with flowers, and sweetness. 
    I think is best  colour for beauty salon websites.

   * Primary: #5c2751 "__Purple__" i chose this as primary colour because i think
   is perfect for influencing cuteness and charm.

   * Secondary: #4c1741 "__Dark Purple__"  Purple combines the stability of the blue color and the energy of the red. Through the ages, purple has always been associated with royalty, nobility and prestige. The color purple can symbolize mystery, magic, power and luxury.
  
   * Tertiary: #9dacff  "__Lilac__" ilac is a shade of purple that can be achieved by mixing white, red and blue. It has been fortified by knowledge and softened through experience. With regards to intensity, this may appear to be closely related to pink. Lilac color meaning can be related to tranquility, peace, and friendship.
  
   * Navigation colour: #76e5fc "__Light Blue__" Light blue is a peaceful, calming color. According to color psychology, blue is associated with trustworthiness and reliability. Blue is also said to promote feelings of tranquility; light blue’s gentle appearance means it is particularly likely to make that impression.

    Colours:

    $primary-color: #5c2751; rgb(92, 39, 81);
    $secondary-color: #4c1741; rgb(76, 23, 65);
    $tertiary-color: #9dacff; rgb(157, 172, 255);
    $navigation-color: #76e5fc; rgb(118, 229, 252);

* __Background__:
  
  The images i used for background are real pictures made in my work,
  because i think is good way of showing to clients what we offer.


 * __Images__:
  
   I used real pictures of my work converted with [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)


## Wireframes:

I built Wireframes using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/sezg2vv/p6gs2pk).  
It was very simple design just to get the idea how is going to look the structure of the page in different devices.
